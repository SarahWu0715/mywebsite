### How do you know the applicant? How long have you known them for?

I am Danyang’s supervisor at ByteDance during her internship. I have known her for 5 months. 

### What would you say are the applicant's key strengths and talents?

Danyang is a very smart and hard-working young woman with a high level of self-motivation at work. During her time at ByteDance, I have watched her rapid growth over the 3-month period. Her unique talents and amiable personality has made her an impactful member of our team. 

I was first impressed by Danyang’s inquisitive nature and ability to learn things quickly and effectively. Joining our team with no previous experience in the Internet industry, she managed to master all the industry jargon and data measures in two weeks by reading internal documents and asking valuable questions. She also learned to manipulate various internal tools and professional visualization tools by herself in a short time, which not only enabled her to produce high-quality work but also significantly improved the efficiency of our work process. 

Danyang has a logical mind and was sensitive to numbers, which made her the main force for data analysis in our team. She has adept SQL and Excel skills that allowed her to conduct complex data analysis and an acute business intuition that enabled her to think from the clients’ side. Danyang has contributed to many projects in our team. For example, the internet traffic project she led has become more mature because of the adjustment and updates she made. She has also analyzed the monthly cases so well that we invited her to be the speaker in our weekly knowledge sharing meeting to explain how she had generated such well-developed analysis. 

In addition, I highly appreciate her extraordinary sense of responsibility in producing the best work and her self-motivation for improving the existing systems. Danyang has been seeking to optimized the work efficiency in every project she was involved in. The SQL templates and the project manuals she created had been useful not only during her time with us but also benefited our team after she left. 

Finally, Danyang is a natural communicator, with a likable character and effective inter-personal skills. She had been smoothly communicating with teams from the technical departments to push projects forward and solve emerging problems. And she also managed to collect much feedback and case information from the business segments that were valuable for our projects. 

### What would you say are the applicant's key weaknesses or areas for improvement?

I did not find any particular weakness in Danyang during her time with us at ByteDance as she was one of the best interns we have ever received. 

In which areas of development has the applicant progressed most in the time you've known them?

Danyang has improved a lot in her understanding for the internet industry and the monetization systems, from having no previous knowledge to being able to conduct business analysis independently for a new monetization product. She has also further honed her analytical skills through extensive practice with real business data in projects, which made her also gain more confidence to be a business analyst in the future. 

### If you are a professional referee, would you work with the applicant post-programme?

Yes, of course. Danyang was an excellent person to work with given her demonstrated professional abilities and active attitudes. I believe that after the MAM program, she would be an even more successful young professional who would make an impact not only in our team, but also any other companies or organizations as well. I will be more than happy to welcome her back to ByteDance, maybe as a business intelligence analyst in the future.
