My name is Danyang (Sarah) Wu, and I am a Masters in Analytics and Management student at London Business School, expected to graduate in June 2022. 

My educational background of studying Analytics and Management at London Business School and Economics and Data Science at Smith College involves not only strong quantitative abilities, but also keen social acumen and excellent communication skills, which were further enriched through my extensive internship experiences. 

Having explored various companies in marketing consultancy, internet industry, and management consulting, I find that working on consulting projects and doing strategic analysis the most enjoyable. Having explored various industries and worked on many challenging projects, I was always thrilled to learn from the brightest minds and not only expanded my professional skillsets but also built more confidence through the accomplishments I made during these experiences. 

The senior exposure that I had when working directly with the management of clients at Deloitte and delivering industry analysis directly to the CEO of product was also precious and fulfilling. The sense of achievement when I see my all-nighters are transformed into my employer or clientsâ€™ business success and see their products indeed benefit thousands of people was also unparalleled. 

Therefore, I am certain that a career in business analytics and consulting is what I like and want to devote to.

Please go to my blogs to see my past experiences,analytical works, and life & interests!
