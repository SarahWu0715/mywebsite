In my free time, I like watching films and thinking over the plots and meanings they conveyed. I am especially interested in Japanese films, particularly those by Hirokazu Koreeda, for their special aesthetic values and thought-provoking stories. I joined the film club on campus and went to weekly screenings to watch the selected films. I also enjoyed sharing my thoughts and feelings with other club members to foster insightful discussions within the community. 

In addition, dancing is also a big part of my life. I have been learning hip-hop, jazz, and urban dance since high school. To keep myself dancing, I joined a dance crew in college and practiced every week for video projects and performances. I have participated in 5 performances on campus with our crew. When I am back home, I also go to dance studios in my city to practice basic skills and learn new choreographies.
